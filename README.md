## Workshop Overview

With Git becoming the industry standard for source-code management, integrating Git into SAS Studio can streamline your software projects like never before. Join us for a hands-on workshop in which you learn how to effectively use Git with SAS Studio on the SAS Viya platform. In this workshop, you learn how to create Git profiles, clone repositories in SAS Studio, and push changes remotely. You learn how to seamlessly create or modify SAS and Python programs, SAS Studio flows, or custom steps and push the changes to your Git repository.

With step-by-step guidance, you'll master key Git operations such as clone, pull, branch, stage, commit, merge, and push.

Taking things to the next level, you will also learn how to work with feature branches: create branches, merge them into the main branch, resolve any merge conflicts.

Additionally, you will learn how to reset a branch to a previous commit, rebase a branch to include commits from other branches and work with stash to save your work in progress, or pop stash to apply the stashed changes.

In a nutshell, the workshop will add Git as a useful tool to your developer's grab bag.
